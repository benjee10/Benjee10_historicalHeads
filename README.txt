HISTORICAL KERBAL HEADS
VERSION 1.1
for KERBAL SPACE PROGRAM 1.11.0+

REQUIRES TEXTURE REPLACER 4.3.1+!

Thank you for downloading Historical Kerbal Heads! This skin pack for TextureReplacer adds a number of kerbal heads based on real-life astronauts and cosmonauts. It also adds 18 non-historical heads to add variety to your crew! 

The Kerbal head textures have been redrawn from the ground up, with increased resolution and fidelity as well as normal maps added, giving a richer, more detailed but still very much Kerbal look.
